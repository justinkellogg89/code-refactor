* This is a code refactor by replacing divs with symantec HTML elements.

* The elements that were changed were mostly divs. With divs throughout the code
it can be hard to read at times and clearly identify which elements are which.

* The elements that were changed include header, footer, aside, and sections (which also contain articles)
